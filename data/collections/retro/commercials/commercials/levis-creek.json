  "summary": "A striking black-and-white Levi's 501 commercial dramatising the 'shrink-to-fit' jeans. Set to Stiltskin's 'Inside', prime minister's daughters spy on a young man swimming in a creek and steal what they think are his jeans. Created with Ansel Adams-style imagery, it's considered one of the finest adverts ever made.",
